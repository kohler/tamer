/** @mainpage Tamer
 *  @section  Introduction
 *
 *  Tamer is a C++ language extension and library that simplifies event-driven
 *  programming.  Functions in Tamer can block to wait for an event, then
 *  resume computation later.  While one function is blocked, other functions
 *  can continue their computation.  This is as easy as threaded programming,
 *  but avoids most synchronization and locking issues and generally requires
 *  less memory.
 *
 *  Most documented Tamer functions and classes can be found under the
 *  "Namespaces" and "Classes" tabs.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Tamer
is a set of libraries and C++ language extensions designed to simplify the
practice of event-driven programming.
.LP
This manual page gives an overview of the
.B Tamer
abstractions, and describes the user-accessible
.B Tamer
methods and functions.  Most
.B Tamer
programs will also use the
.M tamer 1
preprocessor, which converts programs using
.B twait
into conventional C++.
'
.SH OVERVIEW
.B Tamer
introduces four related abstractions for handling concurrency:
.IR events ,
.IR "wait points" ,
.IR rendezvous ", and"
.IR "safe local variables" .
.LP
Each 
.B event 
object represents a future occurrence, such as the completion of a network
read.  When the expected occurrence actually happens\*Efor instance, a
packet arrives\*Ethe event is 
.I triggered
via its
.B trigger
method.  Each active event is associated with exactly one
.B rendezvous
object, which represents a set of related events.  A function can block
until some event on a
.B rendezvous
occurs using a
.B twait
special form.  For example, this function uses
.B Tamer
to print "Done!" after 10 seconds have elapsed.  During that 10 seconds,
the function blocks, allowing other application code to continue
processing.
.sp
.nf
.B "  tamed void f() {"
.B "      twait { tamer::at_delay_sec(10, make_event()); }"
.B "      printf(""Done!\en"");"
.B "  }"
.fi
.SS "Events"
.LP
The
.B make_event
function allocates an event of type
.BR event<T*> , 
where
.B T*
is a sequence of zero to four types determined by
.BR make_event 's
arguments.  This event's 
.B trigger
method has the signature
.B void trigger(T*).
Calling
.B trigger(\fIv*\fB)
marks the event as having occurred, and
passes zero to four results
.IR v* ,
which are called
.IR "trigger values" ,
to whomever is expecting the event.  The types of
.I v*
must match the event's types
.BR T* .
For example:
.nf
.sp
\fB  rendezvous<> \fIr\fB;  int \fIi\fB = 0;
  event<int> \fIe\fB = make_event(\fIr\fB, \fIi\fB);
  \fIe\fB.trigger(100);
  assert(\fIi\fB == 100);               // \fRassertion will succeed
.sp
.fi
When triggered, 
.IR e 's
.B int
trigger value is stored in
.IR i ,
the
.I trigger slot
passed earlier to
.BR make_event .
The type of
.I i
is echoed in
.IR e 's
type
.BR event<int> .
.LP
.B event
objects may be freely assigned, passed as arguments, and copied via copy
constructors\*Eessentially, treated as primitive values.  They are
automatically reference counted.  Each
.B event
may be triggered at most once.  An event that hasn't triggered yet is called
.IR active .
Triggering an active event makes it
.IR empty ;
triggering an empty event has no effect.
.LP
Tamer automatically triggers an active event when its last reference goes
out of scope.  This case is considered a programming error, however, and a
message is printed to indicate the abnormal trigger.
'
.SS "Wait Points and Rendezvous"
.LP
The
.B wait point
language extension, written
.BR twait ,
blocks the calling function until one or more events are triggered.
Blocking causes a function to return to its caller, but its execution point
and safe local variables are preserved in memory.  When an expected event
occurs, the function \*(lqunblocks\*(rq and resumes processing at the wait
point.  By that time, of course, the function's original caller may have
returned.  Any function containing a wait point is marked with the
.B tamed
keyword, which informs the caller that the function can block.
.LP
The first, and more common, form of wait point is written
\*(lq\fBtwait\~{ \fIstatements\fB; }\fR\*(rq.
This executes the
.IR statements ,
then blocks until all events created by
.B make_event 
calls in the
.I statements
have triggered.  (Within the
.IR statements ,
.B make_event
is redefined to a macro that automatically supplies a
.B rendezvous
argument.)
For example, code like \*(lq\fBtwait { tamer::at_delay_sec(\fR10\fB, make_event()); }\fR\*(rq
should be read as \*(lqexecute \fBtamer::at_delay_sec(\fR10\fB, make_event())\fR,
then block until the created event has triggered\*(rq\*Eor,
since
.B tamer::at_delay_sec
triggers its event argument after the given number of seconds has passed, simply as \*(lqblock for 10 seconds\*(rq.
.LP
The second, more flexible form of wait point explicitly names a
.B rendezvous
object, which specifies the set of expected events relevant to the wait
point.  Every 
.B event
object associates with one 
.BR rendezvous .  
A wait point
.B twait(\fIr\fB)
unblocks when 
.I any one
of
.B rendezvous<>
.IR r 's
events occurs.  Unblocking consumes the event and restarts the blocked
function.
.\" The first form of wait point is actually syntactic sugar for
.\" the second: code like \*(lq\fBtwait\~{ \fIstatements\fB; }\fR\*(rq
.\" expands into something like
.\" .nf
.\" .sp
.\" \fB  rendezvous<> \fI__r\fB;
.\"   \fIstatements\fB;      // \fRwhere \fBmake_event\fR calls create events on \fI__r\fB
.\"   while (\fI__r\fB.nevents())
.\"       twait(\fI__r\fB);\fR
.\" .sp
.\" .fi
The 
.B twait()
form can also return information about
.I which
event occurred.  A rendezvous of type
.BR rendezvous<I*> , 
where 
.B I*
is zero to two types, associates
.I event IDs
of type(s)
.BR I*
with events.  The
.B make_event
function specifies event IDs as well as trigger slots.  A 
.B twait(\fIr\fB, \fIi*\fB)
statement sets the variable(s)
.I i*
to the ID(s) of the unblocking event.  The type(s) of
.I i*
must match the type(s) of the
.BR rendezvous .
.LP
.B rendezvous
objects have private copy constructors and assignment operators, preventing
them from being copied.
.LP
A
.B tamed
function's caller resumes when the called function
.IR "either returns or blocks" .
A
.B tamed
function will often accept an
.B event
argument, which it triggers when it completes its processing.
This lets the caller block until the function truly returns.
Here is a
.B tamed
function that blocks, then returns an integer:
.nf
.sp
  \fBtamed void blockf(event<int> \fIdone\fB) {
      \&\fR... block ...\fB
      done.trigger(\fR200\fB);
  }\fR
.sp
.fi
A caller will most likely use
.B twait
to wait for
.B blockf
to return, and so become
.B tamed
itself.
Waiting for events thus trickles up the call stack until a caller
doesn't care whether its callee returns or blocks.
.LP
When an event
.I e
is triggered, 
.B Tamer
enqueues a
.I trigger notification
for 
.IR e 's
event ID on
.IR e 's
rendezvous
.IR r .
This step also unblocks any function blocked on
.BR twait(\fIr\fB) .
Conversely,
.B twait(\fIr\fB)
checks for any queued trigger notifications
.IR r .
If one exists, it is dequeued and returned.  Otherwise, the function blocks
at that wait point; it will unblock and recheck the rendezvous once someone
triggers a corresponding event.  The top-level event loop cycles through
unblocked functions, calling them in some order.
.LP
Multiple functions cannot simultaneously block on the same rendezvous.
.SS "Safe Local Variables"
.LP
Finally, 
.B safe local variables
are variables whose values are preserved across wait points.  The
programmer marks local variables as safe by enclosing them in a
.B tvars{}
block, which preserves their values in a heap-allocated closure.  Function
parameters are always safe.  Unsafe local variables have indeterminate
values after a wait point.  The C++ compiler will often give you an
uninitialized-variable warning when a variable needs to be made safe.
'
.SH EVENT CLASS
The
.B event
template class represents future occurrences.  The template takes zero to
four type arguments, which represent the types of the
.BR event 's
trigger values.  In the following,
.B T0-T3
are the template arguments of the
.B event
type.  If given, these type arguments must be copy-constructible and
assignable.
.sp
.nf
.B event<T*>::event()
.fi
.RS 5
Creates an empty event.  Trigger attempts on the event are ignored;
.B \fIe\fB.empty()
returns true.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B template <typename R, [typename I0, typename I1]>
.B event<T0, T1, T2, T3>::event(R &\fIr\fB, [const I0 &\fIi0\fB, const I1 &\fIi1\fB,]
.B "                             T0 &\fIs0\fB, T1 &\fIs1\fB, T2 &\fIs2\fB, T3 &\fIs3\fB)"
.B ... event<>::event(R &\fIr\fB, [const I0 &\fIi0\fB, const I1 &\fIi1\fB])
.fi
.RS 5
Creates an event on
.B rendezvous
.IR r
with optional event IDs
.IR i0 " and " i1
and trigger slots
.IR s0 ... s3 .
Each 
.B event
type has similar constructors whose slot arguments
.I s*
match the template arguments.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B event<T*>::event(const event<T*> &\fIe\fR)
.B event<T*> &event<T*>::operator=(const event<T*> &\fIe\fR)
.fi
.RS 5
Events may be safely copied and assigned.  After an assignment
\fIe1\fB\~=\~\fIe2\fR, the event objects
.IR e1 " and " e2
refer to the same underlying occurrence; for example, triggering either
causes both to become empty.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B event<T*>::operator bool() const
.fi
.RS 5
Returns true if the event is active.  Empty events return false.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B bool event<T*>::empty() const
.fi
.RS 5
Returns true if the event is empty, meaning it was created empty or has
already been triggered.  \*(lq\fIe\fB.empty()\fR\*(rq is equivalent to
\*(lq\fB!(bool)\fIe\fR\*(rq.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B void event<T0, T1, T2, T3>::trigger(const T0 &\fIv0\fB, const T1 &\fIv1\fB,

.B ... void event<>::trigger()
.fi
.RS 5
Triggers the event.  If the event is empty, this does nothing; otherwise,
it sets the event's trigger slots (defined at creation time) to the
trigger values
.IR v0 ... v3
and wakes any blocked closure.  Events become empty after
they are triggered.  Each
.B event
type has a
.B trigger
method whose value arguments
.I v*
have types that match the template arguments.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B void event<T*>::at_trigger(const event<> &\fItrigger_evt\fB)
.fi
.RS 5
Registers
.I trigger_evt
for cancel notification.  If this event is already empty,
.I trigger_evt
is triggered immediately.  Otherwise,
.I trigger_evt
is triggered when this event is triggered.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B event<> event<T*>::bind_all() const
.fi
.RS 5
Returns a version of this event that has no trigger slots.  The returned
event refers to the same occurrence as this event, so triggering either
event makes both events appear empty.  However,
.B bind_all().trigger()
will leave this event's slots unchanged.
.RE
'
.SH "RENDEZVOUS CLASS"
The
.B rendezvous
template class groups related events.  The template takes zero to
two type arguments, which represent the types of the
.BR rendezvous 's
event IDs.  In the following,
.BR I0 " and " I1
are the template arguments of the
.B rendezvous
type.  If given, these type arguments must be copy-constructible and
assignable.
.sp
.nf
.B rendezvous<I*>::rendezvous()
.fi
.RS 5
Creates a new rendezvous with no outstanding events.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B unsigned rendezvous<I*>::nevents() const
.fi
.RS 5
Returns the count of outstanding events.  This includes events that have
not yet triggered, and events that have triggered, but the trigger
notification has not been collected yet.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B unsigned rendezvous<I*>::nready() const
.fi
.RS 5
Returns the count of ready events.  An event is ready if it has been
triggered, but the trigger notification has not been collected yet.  The
.B rendezvous<I*>::join
method will return true only if
.B nready()
is greater than 0.
.RE
.sp
.B unsigned rendezvous<I*>::nwaiting() const
.fi
.RS 5
Returns the count of waiting events.  An event is waiting if it has not yet
triggered.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B bool rendezvous<I0, I1>::join(I0 &\fIi0\fB, I1 &\fIi1\fB)
.B bool rendezvous<I0>::join(I0 &\fIi0\fB)
.B bool rendezvous<>::join()
.fi
.RS 5
Collects a trigger notification, if any events have triggered but have not
yet been collected.  If a trigger notification is available, sets the event
ID argument(s)
.IR i0 " and " i1 ,
if any, to the collected event's ID(s) and returns true.  Otherwise,
returns false.  The
.B twait
special forms are built around calls to
.BR rendezvous<I*>::join .
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B void rendezvous<I*>::clear()
.fi
.RS 5
Removes all pending events from this rendezvous.  Any active events on this
rendezvous are effectively triggered, calling their
.B at_trigger()
notifiers and making the events themselves empty.  After
.BR clear() ,
the rendezvous's
.B nevents()
method returns 0.
.RE
'
.SH "EVENT MODIFIERS"
These functions manipulate events generically, for example by returning
one event that triggers two others.
.sp
.nf
.B event<> distribute(const event<> &\fIe1\fB, const event<> &\fIe2\fB)
.fi
.RS 5
Returns an event that distributes trigger operations over
.IR e1 " and " e2 .
Triggering the returned event will trigger both
.IR e1 " and " e2
automatically.  The returned event is empty if and only if both
.IR e1 " and " e2
are empty.
.RE
.sp
.nf
.B event<> bind(const event<T0> &\fIe\fB, const T0 &\fIv0\fB)

.SH "DRIVER"
The
.B driver
class handles
.BR Tamer 's 
fundamental events: timers, signals, and file descriptors.  Most programs
will use the single

Triggers event
.I e
when
.I fd
becomes readable, or when
.I fd
is closed or encounters an error, whichever comes first.
.I fd
must be a valid file descriptor less than

.BR event<int> ,
the trigger value is 0 when

Rather, the signal handler marks the signal's occurrence, then blocks the
signal from further delivery.  The signal remains blocked until
.IR e
has been triggered and any corresponding closure has run (and possibly
registered another event to catch the signal).  Thus, programmers can
safely catch signals without race conditions.

.SH "CANCEL ADAPTERS"
These functions integrate timeouts, signals, and other forms of canceling
into existing events.  For example:

.I i
is set to
.IR e 's
trigger value.

.I delay
seconds elapse.
.I i
is set to

Returns a timeout-adapted version of
.IR e .
When the returned event is triggered,

.B event<int> add_signal(const std::vector<int> &\fIsignals\fB, event<int> \fIe\fB)
.fi
.RS 5
Returns a signal-adapted version of
.IR e .
When the returned event is triggered,
.I e
is triggered with the same trigger value.
If, however, the

.IR signals )
happens first, then

Return cancel-adapted versions of
.IR e .
When
.I e
triggers, the
.I result
variable is set to one of the following constants to indicate why:
.RS 2
.IP "\fB0\fR" 15
if
.I e
triggered successfully.
.IP "\fB\-ETIMEDOUT\fR" 15
if
.I e
timed out.
.IP "\fB\-EINTR\fR" 15
if
.I e
was interrupted by a signal.

The constants
.BR tamer::outcome:: { success ,
.BR timeout ,
.BR signal }
may be used instead of the error values.

.SH "FILE I/O"
.BR Tamer 's
support for file I/O is available via
.BR "#include <tamer/fd.hh>" .
Variants of the main I/O system calls are provided, most of them
nonblocking.  See
.M tamer_fd 3 .
'
.SH BUGS
The existing
.B fd
wrappers are only truly nonblocking for pipe, socket, and network I/O.  The
functions will block on disk I/O.
.LP
The
.B Tamer
interface differs in several ways from the interface described in
\*(lqEvents Can Make Sense\*(rq by Krohn et al.  First, all
.B Tamer
classes and functions are declared in the
.B tamer
namespace.  
.RB \*(lq "using namespace tamer;" \*(rq
will bring them into the global namespace.
Second,
.B Tamer
events are created with
.BR make_event
(rather than
.BR mkevent ),
which more closely follows the C++ standard library's style.  Third,
.B Tamer
primitive events are registered with functions
.BR at_time ,
.BR at_fd_read ,
and
.BR at_fd_write
rather than
.BR timer
and
.BR wait_on_fd ;
the
.B at_
convention will generalize better to future classes of events.  Finally,
.B tamed
functions in
.B Tamer
are declared using code like \*(lq\fBtamed void f()\fR\*(rq, not
\*(lq\fBtamed f()\fR\*(rq.
.LP
The
.B Tamer
interface also differs substantially from that of
.BR Tame ,
which is distributed as part of
.BR sfslite .

The SFSlite libraries for writing asynchronous programs include the
original
.B Tame
processor and libraries.  The SFSlite libraries are larger and more
full-featured than
.BR Tamer ,
but also harder to use.  SFSlite is available at
